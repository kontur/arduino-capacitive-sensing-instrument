#Arduino capacitive sensing instrument

This repository contains the code for a simple instrument made with Arduino, capacitive sensors and Puredata.

Note that most of the Puredata files are comprised of example code from the Puredata documentation.

Even though the code might work for many different kind of physical setups, given they are connected to the Arduino Uno or coompatible board in this specific way, it is mostly code unique to one specific physical instrument with the capacitive sensor elements constructed inside.

And this is what it looks like :)

The top is made out of apple hardwood with the sensor plates inside, and in the bottom part made from brass the Arduino and wiring is contained. The box is connected to any computer running Puredata via USB and communicated with Puredata via the serial port.


*Feel free to use any of the included code for whatever purpose you can think up.*
