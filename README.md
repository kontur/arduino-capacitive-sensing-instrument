#Arduino capacitive sensing instrument

This repository contains the code for a simple instrument made with Arduino, capacitive sensors and Puredata.

Note that most of the Puredata files are comprised of example code from the Puredata documentation.

Even though the code might work for many different kind of physical setups, given they are connected to the Arduino Uno or coompatible board in this specific way, it is mostly code unique to one physical instrument with the capacitive sensor elements constructed inside.
